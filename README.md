A youtube audio downloader with a simple gui

You can download playlists and single videos with it. Well you only get to download the audio files

This is as anyone would be able to tell the exact same source code as my simple youtube downloader with gui  but changed a bit to be for audio specifically. 

A small peculiarity born from my laziness is the fact that if someone has used both scripts they would be able to see that there is an extra button for extension change but no text box for it. The reason for that is that it will actually get the extension from the directory change text box so you just need to put the extension there and press the correct button. The default extension is .mp3.

# changing the extension
Now since this might sound a bit weird to note but you just need to put the extension there without the dot like I've shown in the screenshot
